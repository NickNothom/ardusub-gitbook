# Relays

Relays are useful for turning higher voltage (>5V DC) auxiliary equipment on and off. 

Up to three relays can be operated via joystick button functions when connected to the appropriate signal outputs.

Most autopilots cannot provide power to the output rail to trigger the relays, so a 5V power supply will need to be connected to an empty output.
